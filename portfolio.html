            <h2 class="center">Context & Challenges</h2>
            <p>This project was undertaken whilst studying Frontend Development for Designers with CareerFoundry. As a new UI designer I wanted to develop a platform that would speak to who I am as a person and a designer, and provide all necessary
              information to potential employers and people within my network.</p>

          <div class="background" data-scroll>
            <p class="center">I wanted the user to be able to achieve 3 goals when they visited my site:</p><br>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <div class="center">

              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <div class="center">
                  <div class="numbered-list">

            <p>Although I had no coding experience I began studying <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> and was able to develop my new skills by putting what I was learning into practice. I had the option to use online website builders and
              templates, but I have always had an interest in coding and wanted to push myself to develop a new skill. I also believed it would allow more freedom in my designs and greater ownership of how I presented my work.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <div class="center">
            <h2>Process & Insights</h2>
            <p>I wanted my portfolio to achieve two main things:</p>
            <p><i class="far fa-check-square"></i> Be clear and easy to navigate</p>
            <p><i class="far fa-check-square"></i> Represent me and my personality</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <div class="background" data-scroll>
            <p>My first step was to decide what content was required, and to then sketch wireframes of how I wanted these elements to be presented. I wanted to keep the number of pages to as few as possible so decided on:</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-3">
                <div class="center">
                  <i class="fas fa-home"></i>
                  <p><u>Home page</u> including a brief description of me and links to my projects</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-3">
                <div class="center">
                  <i class="far fa-address-card"></i>
                  <p><u>About page</u> with a link to my CV, a more detailed biography and information about my skills</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-3">
                <div class="center">
                  <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i>
                  <p><u>A project page for each project</u> showing a detailed case study of my design process</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-3">
                <div class="center">
                  <i class="fas fa-paper-plane"></i>
                  <p><u>Contact information</u> included in both the header and footer</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <p>It was important to me that the interface was clear and uncluttered and I therefore wanted to utilise white space. I added a bright highlight colour to key pieces of text to draw the eye of the user and make the interface more
              exciting.</p>
            <div class="center">
              <p><span>Look at me!</span></p>
            </div>
            <p>By using a professional, clear design I am able to use the same design elements on other platforms, including my <a href="files/CV.pdf" class="pink">CV</a>, to develop and build my personal brand.</p>
            <p>I created mockups in XD for each page of the site so that I always knew what the code needed to achieve. Once I was happy with the design I began writing the HTML for each page. I then added a CSS stylesheet to achieve the presentation
              and design I was after.</p>
            <p>I wanted to ensure that my website was responsive and could be used on both mobile and desktop. I designed from a mobile-first approach and used media queries to define any content that would differ on larger screens. </p>
            <p>Although some changes were made along the way I was able to create a website that closely resembled my initial designs. Once the layout and styling was complete I added some CSS animations and JavaScript to enhance the functionality
              and usability.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <h2 class="center">Testing</h2>
            <p>At this point I was happy with what I had achieved, but I wanted to learn what other users thought of the website. I conducted user testing, asking the participants to complete some scenario based tests and tell me
              what they liked, disliked and what was missing.</p>
            <p>The feedback was positive, with no problems arising from navigation or usability, but a handful of cosmetic changes were suggested. I analysed all feedback and implemented the required changes.</p>
            <p>The most significant feedback was in regards to the logo, which a number of users felt wasn’t clear and didn’t work with the rest of the design. I therefore changed it as below. Further tests highlighted no issues with the new design.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
              <picture>
                <img src="img/portfolio-project/logos@2x.png" class="width-700" data-scroll alt="Examples of first and second logo design">
              </picture>
            </div><br>
            <div>
              <p>I also conducted my own cross-browser testing to ensure that the website could be accessed from the most common browsers and devices with no issues.</p>
              <div class="center">
                <picture>
                  <img src="img/portfolio-project/browsers@2x.png" class="width-700" data-scroll alt="No issues on any of the popular browsers and devices">
                </picture>
              </div><br>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>My final accessibility test checked that the contrast of all my text was user friendly as I wanted to ensure that all users could view all content. One of the colours I had chosen did not pass AA level and was therefore changed to
                comply.</p>
              <div class="center">
                <picture>
                  <img src="img/portfolio-project/contrast@2x.png" class="width-700" data-scroll alt="Colour adjusted to comply with contrast grades">
                </picture>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <h2 class="center">Result</h2>
            <p>I will continue to update my portfolio as I complete new projects, or as requirements change. However, I am really happy with my published site and my first foray into frontend development. Putting the skills I was learning into
              practice on a real world project was hugely beneficial and meant that I could develop and troubleshoot as I progressed.</p>
            <p>I think having an understanding of coding capabilities and restrictions will have a positive impact on both my UI designs and communications with development teams on future projects.</p>
